- at beginning, read all course info into an arrayList of course objects
- user and pass for admin is Admin, Admin001
- how track a student's courses
- how to store a list of students
-serialization convert state into byte stream, then reverted into a copy of that object. implement java.io.Serializable. 

[] At beginning of program, check presence of .ser file in project. 
	if yes; deserialize AllData Object 
	else no; read from csv. Serialize, then deserialize again and use it. 
	serialize process for classes
		read in that csv file
		while there is a line
			split on commas and add to string array
			set each index to a variable
			add all those variables to the AllData arrayList as course object
		serialize and then deserialize and use
